# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset (1.6M Tweets)

Developed a logistic regression model to classify tweets as positive or negative using the Sentiment140 dataset consisting of 1.6 million tweets.
Processed raw text data by cleaning, stemming, and removing stopwords using NLTK for effective text pre-processing.
Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization to convert textual data into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
Achieved an accuracy of 77.8% on test data after training a Logistic Regression model.
Implemented model evaluation using accuracy score for performance measurement.
Employed Pickle for saving and loading the trained model, facilitating future predictions on new data.
Key Modules and Libraries:

Pandas for dataset handling and manipulation.
NumPy for numerical operations.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for stopword removal and text preprocessing.
Scikit-learn for vectorization (TF-IDF), model training (Logistic Regression), and evaluation (accuracy score).
Pickle for saving/loading models.
